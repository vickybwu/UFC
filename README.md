# UFC Fighter Data Shiny App
Marcus scrapped the data from https://www.foxsports.com/ufc/stats?weightclass=11&category=BASIC
I built the app

## You can launch the app on R by running: runGitHub( "UFC", "vickybwu") 
- Scatterplot of your chosen varibales 
- Choose to show or not show data table of all figher stats 
- Show data table of one particular fighter of your choice
- Barplot of the fighter data you chose
